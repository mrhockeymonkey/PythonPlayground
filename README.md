# Python Playground

A collection of python scripts created as part of learning python.

Tips:
* Use dir(<object>) to explore what its members
* Use type(<object>) to see the object type
* Use list(<object>) when object is an array to see how it will look to each itteration of a loop

WHY IS THIS INDENTED!? :(

Debugging:
* To add in a sense check use assert

```
important_value = 1
assert important_value == 0, 'i expected 0!?!?'
```
