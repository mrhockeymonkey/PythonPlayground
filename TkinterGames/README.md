# Tkinter Games
This is some experimentation with tkinter for creating gui versions of:

* Poker Dice
* Hangman
* Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Minesweeper

Each game is tied together into a console that allows player to choose which gae to play. 

To run:
```
python .\GuiGame.py
```

## Poker Dice
For ease i lost the concept of rolling dice in the gui but it is still there in code. Also lost the concept 
of re-drawing cards. In reality this game simply draws a random 5 cards, orders and evaluates the winner

## Hangman

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Minesweeper
Not really implemented as a playable game, this was more of an experiment in generating buttons programatically.
